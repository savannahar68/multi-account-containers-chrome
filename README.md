# Multi Account Containers for Chrome (On HOLD)

On Hold - There's no api like contextualIdentities in chrome, so thinking ways of implementing cookie factory.

Replicating the famous [Multi-Account-Container addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) for chrome.

"The Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives â€“ no more opening a different browser just to check your work email!"
